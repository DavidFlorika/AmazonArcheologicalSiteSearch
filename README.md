# Archeological Sites Search

---

## 1. Overview

**This project was originally intented for the Kaggle [OpenAi A-to-Z Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/openai-to-z-challenge) Competition.**

This project uses GEE(Google Earth Engine) and ChatGPT to search over the Amazonia area in finding possible archeological sites. We used *gpt-4o-mini* in getting acheological feedback for computed data.

GEE Data set was used to compute NDVI(Index for plant richness) and DEM(Elevation) to possibly select candidate sites.

*Note:* Archeological Sites Search is a premature attempt to use ChatGPT combined with GEE to process geological data and investigate possible usage of AI in aarcheological studies.
